## Challenges

The challenges for this project were both frustrating and rewarding once they got worked through. 

A couple of the challenges:
    
1. My text box for the search was not mapping the inputs to the right place.
    - This challenge I reached out for help with as it presented quite a bit of frustration but with help and numerous console logs the challenge was worked through
2. The Text boxes for my add a movie feature was not taking in any text.
    - This challenge was due to having the wrong inputs getting saved to the text boxes. Once that was fixed the boxes kept the text and was able to submit the new movie to the bottom of the list.
